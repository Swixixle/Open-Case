# Open Case

A cryptographically signed government accountability investigation engine.

Open Case cross-references public records — campaign finance, lobbying filings, legislative votes, judicial filings — to surface **proximity and timing patterns** between money and decisions. Findings are epistemically tagged, source-linked, and sealed with Ed25519. The system documents **patterns in public records**; it does **not** assert corruption, guilt, or legal wrongdoing.

**Philosophy:** Receipts, not verdicts. This is a mirror of public records, not a verdict machine.

## Verifying this README

Claims below are checked against the repository. If something drifts, use:

| Claim | Where to verify |
|-------|-----------------|
| Automated bundle | `python3 scripts/verify_documentation.py` — pattern rule count (18), client `package.json` scripts, assist router wiring, Debrief structure evidence, pytest collect vs CI floor |
| Claim index (for tools) | `docs/VERIFIABLE_CLAIMS.json` — maps statements to files and the script above |
| Language mix & `client/` + `server/` layout | `docs/DEBRIEF_STRUCTURE_EVIDENCE.json` + `docs/DEBRIEF_CLAIMS_FOR_DCI.md` (regenerate: `python3 scripts/generate_debrief_evidence.py`). Use the `.md` as the **Debrief corpus** for those claims so they are not re-inferred from README. Inflated Python counts from other tools usually include `venv`/`node_modules`; the evidence file uses explicit exclusions. |
| Pattern rule IDs & engine version | `engines/pattern_engine.py` — `PATTERN_RULE_IDS`, `PATTERN_ENGINE_VERSION` |
| Test count | `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/` (full suite). CI enforces a **minimum** passed count via `server/scripts/ci_pytest_floor.py` (see **Tests** below). |
| HTTP API | Run the app and open `GET /openapi.json` |
| Environment | `.env.example` |
| Client scripts | `client/package.json` — `dev`, `build`, `preview` |

## Documented exemplar (Tom Cotton / SOFT_BUNDLE)

**Tom Cotton — SOFT_BUNDLE_V1 — score ~0.921** appears in calibration tooling and docs as a **reference exemplar** when FEC + Senate roll-call data align with expectations. **Your deployment does not automatically show this score:** it requires a **case**, **`POST /api/v1/cases/{id}/investigate`** with working keys, and evidence that satisfies the rule. Synthetic tests prove rule behavior; production scores depend on live data.

## What it does

1. **Create a case** for a subject (many `subject_type` values exist in `core/subject_taxonomy.py`).
2. **Run investigation** — **`POST /api/v1/cases/{case_id}/investigate`** (Bearer API key). This runs **synchronously** in the HTTP request: ingest adapters → evidence → signals → **pattern engine** → seal. It is **not** continuous real-time surveillance of every official unless **you** schedule or trigger investigations externally.
3. The **pattern engine** scores proximity and structure (**18 pattern rules** in `PATTERN_RULE_IDS` — money/vote timing, fingerprints, sector/geo, procurement loops for local pilot, etc.). Outputs are **alerts and scores**, not legal findings.
4. **Epistemic** classification at ingest (`VERIFIED`, `REPORTED`, etc.).
5. **Cryptographic seal** on the case bundle (`payloads.py` / `signing.py` — JCS-canonical JSON, SHA-256, Ed25519).
6. **Optional:** LLM-assisted story angles (`POST /api/v1/assist/story-angles`) and routed Perplexity/Gemini/Claude for senator dossier enrichment — **core detection does not use LLMs**.

---

## Epistemic levels

Every finding is tagged at ingest. Classification is source-driven, not sentiment-driven.

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `VERIFIED` | Official record — court document, regulatory finding, government disclosure |
| `REPORTED` | Credible named-source journalism or official statement |
| `ALLEGED` | Formal complaint or legal allegation — not yet adjudicated |
| `DISPUTED` | Formal rebuttal or contrary finding on record |
| `CONTEXTUAL` | Unverified public discourse — hidden from public responses by default |

---

## Pattern engine

**Version** `PATTERN_ENGINE_VERSION` in `engines/pattern_engine.py` (e.g. `2.7`). **18 pattern rules** in `PATTERN_RULE_IDS`:

| Rule | Signal |
|------|--------|
| `COMMITTEE_SWEEP_V1` | Donations from industries under direct committee oversight |
| `FINGERPRINT_BLOOM_V1` | Cross-case donor fingerprints |
| `SOFT_BUNDLE_V1` | Donor clustering around legislative events |
| `SOFT_BUNDLE_V2` | Donor clustering (v2 weights: sector, baseline, hearings) |
| `SECTOR_CONVERGENCE_V1` | Sector donation concentration vs committee jurisdiction |
| `GEO_MISMATCH_V1` | Geographic donor anomalies |
| `DISBURSEMENT_LOOP_V1` | PAC disbursement patterns |
| `JOINT_FUNDRAISING_V1` | Joint fundraising committee signals |
| `BASELINE_ANOMALY_V1` | Deviation from historical baseline |
| `ALIGNMENT_ANOMALY_V1` | Vote/donor alignment anomalies |
| `AMENDMENT_TELL_V1` | Amendment timing vs donor activity |
| `HEARING_TESTIMONY_V1` | Testimony/donor overlap (degrades without GovInfo credentials) |
| `REVOLVING_DOOR_V1` | LDA / employment transition overlap with donors |
| `LEGISLATIVE_RELATED_ENTITY_DONOR_V1` | Curated PAC/affiliate vs donor-of-record near roll-call votes |
| `LOCAL_CONTRACTOR_DONOR_LOOP_V1` | Local procurement vendor ↔ donor (direct / curated alias) |
| `LOCAL_CONTRACT_DONATION_TIMING_V1` | Donation timing vs contract award (local, award-only) |
| `LOCAL_VENDOR_CONCENTRATION_V1` | Top vendor vs top donor overlap (local) |
| `LOCAL_RELATED_ENTITY_DONOR_V1` | Curated related-entity donor vs vendor (local) |

Some rules are **conditional** on optional API keys or curated alias data — see `routes/investigate.py` and `docs/internal/PUBLIC_RECORD_STATE.md`.

## Subject types vs adapter depth

The **schema** supports many branches and levels (mayor, judge, council, boards, etc.). **Adapter coverage is not uniform:**

- **Federal legislators (FEC + Congress pipeline):** Deepest path — votes, donations, many pattern rules.
- **Federal / Article III judges:** CourtListener + FJC; FEC skipped; pattern alerts often sparse without donation/vote fingerprints.
- **`government_level=local`:** Investigation uses **Indiana IDIS + Indianapolis** procurement and contracts adapters today — **not** a generic US municipal stack. Other local jurisdictions need new adapters.

---

## Data sources

**Implemented in code** (`adapters/`, `routes/investigate.py`):

| Source | What the code does |
|--------|---------------------|
| FEC | Schedule A/B, committees, optional historical/JFC paths — API key optional (`DEMO_KEY` rate-limited). |
| Congress.gov | Votes, amendments — **`CONGRESS_API_KEY` recommended** (degraded behavior if missing). |
| LDA | Lobbying filings — public API without key in typical use. |
| CourtListener | Judicial search — optional `COURTLISTENER_API_KEY`. |
| FJC | Judge bios — HTTP. |
| USASpending | Awards/obligations. |
| GovInfo | Hearings/packages — **requires `GOVINFO_API_KEY`** where used; otherwise skipped or empty. |
| Regulations.gov | **Requires `REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY`** when used. |
| Indiana (IDIS bulk) | Indiana disclosure CSVs for local pipeline. |
| Indiana CF portal | **`adapters/indiana_cf.py`** — manual links / gap documented; **not** automated bulk. |
| Indianapolis | Contracts + procurement adapters for **`government_level=local`**. |

**Roadmap / not implemented as first-class adapters:** See `adapters/planned.py` and issues — e.g. PACER, broad local campaign finance beyond pilot scope.

---

## Judicial pilot note

**Indianapolis (S.D. Indiana) + Chicago (N.D. Illinois)** appear in pilot seeding scripts. A **diagnostic narrative** (e.g. Judge Sweeney) reflects **adapter behavior** when CourtListener/FJC return data; **zero pattern alerts** for typical judicial cases without FEC/vote fingerprints is **expected** with current rules.

---

## Static demo directory (not the production database)

The React app lists **reference senators** (e.g. Sullivan, Cotton, Ernst, …) from `client/src/data/officialsDirectory.js` when the API has no cases. That is **UI demo data**, not a guarantee that your database contains completed investigations for each name.

---

## Project structure

```
adapters/       Source integrations (FEC, Congress, CourtListener, FJC, LDA, USASpending, Indianapolis, …)
alembic/        Database migrations (`alembic/versions/` — multiple phase files)
client/         React/Vite — `npm run build` → `client/dist` mounted at `/app`
server/         Python package (`server/services/`, `server/scripts/` — e.g. CI floor, investigate helpers)
core/           Subject taxonomy, credentials, admin gate
data/           Source registry, entity aliases, fixtures
engines/        Pattern engine, signals, entity resolution, temporal proximity
routes/         FastAPI routers (`/cases`, `/api/v1/...`, optional `assist`)
scripts/        CI floor, calibration, pilot seed, diagnostics
services/       Dossier, epistemics, LLM/research routers, gap analysis
tests/          Pytest suite (see **Tests**)
main.py         FastAPI app + static `/app`
models.py       SQLAlchemy models
payloads.py     Sealing / signing payloads
signing.py      Ed25519 helpers
```

**Debrief / DCI:** If Debrief still labels structure claims as **inferred**, it is almost certainly scanning the **full README** (or the whole repo) and re-deriving file counts. **Point your DCI run at the committed bundle instead:** **`docs/DEBRIEF_CLAIMS_FOR_DCI.md`** (short, auto-generated, same sentences as the evidence file) plus **`docs/DEBRIEF_STRUCTURE_EVIDENCE.json`** (SHA-256 of marker files and sorted path lists). Regenerate both after structural changes: `python3 scripts/generate_debrief_evidence.py`.

---

## Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/
```

- **Full suite:** **344** tests collected (run locally to confirm current count).
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `server/scripts/ci_pytest_floor.py`, which requires **≥ 201** passed (regression floor). If the README cites “344,” that is the **current** full run; CI’s floor may lag until updated intentionally.

---

## API (sample)

Case CRUD under **`/cases`**; investigation and JSON reports under **`/api/v1`**.

**OpenAPI:** `GET /openapi.json` — this checkout registered **~47 paths / 48 HTTP operations** (FastAPI route table). Exact counts change with new routes.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|
| POST | `/cases` | Create case (Bearer) |
| GET | `/cases/{case_id}` | Case + evidence |
| GET | `/api/v1/cases` | List/filter cases |
| POST | `/api/v1/cases/{case_id}/investigate` | Run pipeline (Bearer) |
| GET | `/api/v1/cases/{case_id}/report` | Signed report JSON |
| GET | `/api/v1/cases/{case_id}/report/view` | HTML report |
| GET | `/api/v1/cases/{case_id}/report/pattern-events` | SSE (pattern refresh) |
| POST | `/api/v1/findings/{finding_id}/dispute` | Dispute (Bearer) |
| POST | `/api/v1/assist/story-angles` | Optional LLM story angles (Bearer + server LLM keys) |
| GET | `/api/v1/subjects/search` | Subject search (`name` query + optional filters) |
| GET | `/api/v1/methodology` | Methodology text |

Admin routes need **`X-Admin-Secret`** / configured **`ADMIN_SECRET`**.

**Routers:** `services/llm_router.py` (story angles), `services/perplexity_router.py` (research enrichment routing).

## Setup (development)

### Backend (repo root)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swixixle/Open-Case.git
cd Open-Case
python -m venv .venv   # optional
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# DATABASE_URL: defaults to SQLite in .env.example (omit for same)
# FEC_API_KEY: optional; public DEMO_KEY is rate-limited
# CONGRESS_API_KEY: optional; improves member/vote matching
# ADMIN_SECRET: needed for admin-only routes
# Production: set OPEN_CASE_* signing keys explicitly (do not rely on auto-generated keys)

alembic upgrade head
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Frontend (optional — serves `/app` when built)

```bash
cd client
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..
# Restart uvicorn so client/dist is visible
```

**Client `package.json` scripts:** `npm run dev` (Vite dev server), `npm run build` (production bundle), `npm run preview` (preview production build). There is **no** `npm start` — production serves static files via FastAPI or any static host.

**Local frontend (`npm run dev` in `client/`):** Copy `client/.env.example` to `client/.env.local` and set:

- `VITE_OPEN_CASE_API_BASE` — e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (your local FastAPI).
- `VITE_OPEN_CASE_API_KEY` — a valid investigator API key (`open_case_…`).

`client/src/lib/api.js` reads only `import.meta.env.VITE_*` variables. **Restart the Vite process** after editing `.env.local`; Vite does not hot-reload env. If `VITE_OPEN_CASE_API_KEY` is missing, authenticated calls (cases list, search) fail and the home page can fall back to the static list in `client/src/data/officialsDirectory.js`.

**Proxy note:** `client/vite.config.js` proxies same-origin `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in dev, so a local `uvicorn` matches `curl` to localhost. Set `VITE_OPEN_CASE_API_BASE` to a full URL (e.g. a deployed host) to bypass the proxy and use a **remote** API. **Profile routes:** `http://localhost:5173/official/{uuid}` loads the **case** report; `http://localhost:5173/official/{bioguide_id}` loads a **senator dossier** (`GET /api/v1/senators/{id}/dossier`), which is separate from a completed case investigation.

### Test

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/
```
